&emsp;&emsp;Assembly Project

    This assembly program takes one input from an input file, this is an integer array.
    This program finds a sequence according to increasing order, this program can find more
    than one sequence but has to return only one sequence that has a maximum length.

&emsp;&emsp;MIPS Processor

    There are 8 registers each holding 32 bit numbers. The instruction width is 16 bits
    instead of 32 bits in MIPS. There are two types of instructions in MiniMIPS.
